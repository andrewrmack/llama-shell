# llama-shell
At this point, llama-shell is a very basic shell and is only capable of running single commands. A cd command is included. Still to-do:
* Signal handling
* Pipes and other multi-command lines
* Scripting ability
* Shell environment
* Adjust command max size to the OS max

# Development
*This is the development branch of llama-shell*. Things here will often be
broken or will not work consistently.
